      <h2>Brief History</h2>

      <p>Vestein Investment Group was started in 2017 at the wake of the
        Ethereum boom. The founders began to see the potential of cryptocurrency
        after witnessing the successful run of Ethereum, Ark, Stratis, Litecoin,
        and many other altcoins. The exponential rate at which some of the
        cryptocurrencies grew after their Initial Coin Offering (ICO) served
        as evidence that cryptos were not to be taken lightly as an investment
        option. For instance the price per share of bitcoin surpassed the price
        of the S&P 500 in April of this year as shown figure 1. This incredible
        bitcoin milestone took less than a decade to materialize. </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, the SEC’s regulation interest in the crypto space offered more
          evidence that, perhaps, cryptocurrencies would be legitimized in the foreseeable
         future. Putting the global money in perspective as shown figure 2, it is clear
         that the market cap of bitcoin, which was approximately 41 billion in early 2017,
         is on an upward trajectory. This 41 billion market cap has more than doubled since
         the publication of figure 2. Moreover, the whole cryptocurrency market cap has
         increased more than 70 billion in the same time span. All these factors reinforced
         the founders’ vision that cryptocurrencies would make a lucrative long term investment.
         These conclusions led to the birth of Vestein Investment Group.
