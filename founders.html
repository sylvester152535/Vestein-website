      <h2>Sylvester Amponsah, Co-Founder & CEO</h2>

      <p>
        Sylvester, co-founder of Vestein Investment Group, is a Master’s of Electrical
        Engineering <br>candidate and a Gates Millennium Scholar at Case Western Reserve
        University. He is one of the ten winners of the 2015 OZY Media Genius Awards.
        Sylvester started trading stocks in 2012. Despite his five years of experience,
        he does not classify himself as an expert. His curiosity in new technology led
        him to research about Ethereum and other altcoins in December of 2016. He
        invested in Ethereum at $10 per share in January of 2017 and gained a 40x
        return on his initial investment. He has subsequently invested in numerous
        altcoins and ICO’s. These days he is more interested in using statistical
        models to study the cryptocurrency market. </p>
